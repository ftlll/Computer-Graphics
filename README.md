## Table of Contents

### Object Modelling and Animation

- [Object Modelling and Animation](./Object%20Animation/README.md)
  Explore techniques for creating and animating 3D objects, including vertex transformations, mesh manipulation, and animation keyframes.

### Triangle Rasterization

- [Triangle Rasterization](./Triangle%20Rasterization/README.md)
  Implement core rasterization algorithms for triangles, including edge walking, barycentric coordinates, and shading methods to render 2D and 3D geometry.

### Shading Techniques & Image Outputs

- [Rendering Methods Comparison (Wireframe to Phong)](./Z-Buffer%20&%20Shading/README.md)
  Visualize and compare different shading techniques like Wireframe, Constant, Flat, Gouraud, and Phong shading in a grid of images.

### GPU Programming

- [Spiral of Squares, Fractal Chain, Magnifier, and Waves](./GPU%20Programming/README.md)
  Implement various fragment and vertex shaders to create patterns, fractals, magnification effects, and wave geometry deformation.

### Polyhedral Mesh Manipulation

- [Mesh Construction, Edge Navigation, Truncation, and Coloring](./Polyhedral%20Mesh%20Traversal%20&%20Truncation/README.md)
  Build polyhedral meshes, traverse and manipulate edges, truncate meshes repeatedly, and apply dynamic face colors.
